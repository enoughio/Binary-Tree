## My Binary Tree simulator            CARE-C

This is a project that draws an actual binary tree from the given input 

Now this not only shows the data in binary tree format but also stores it as a binary tree using the data structures

I take the input from the user and map that input value(number) to a node of the tree and also decide where it should go to the left of the previous node or  to the right for that the nodes need to carry some extra attributes like- toLeft or tonight

then it uses a pre-written code  (not written  by me) generating a tree-like structure in D3.js

and used those extra attributes it decide the node placement direction, 

it uses D3.js for drawing the visual element on the DOM with the corresponding input,  

Tech used- 
HTML,
CSS,
JS, D3.js

Reason-
From the start when I was introduced to the binary tree data structures I wanted to make a visual representation of it,

As it is an implementation technique that stores data in a certain manner, we can't see any binary in real screen
so I tried to find some logic and people like Salih Erdem Kaymak who have done this previously 

and finally, after 2 months of work, finally completed this mini-project that I always wanted to.

and a special thanks to Salih Erdem Kaymak for guiding me throughout this project.
